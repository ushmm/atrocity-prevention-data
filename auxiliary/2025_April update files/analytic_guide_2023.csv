"1",105,"Peace operations","Tool","Peace operations_tool","Deployment of military and/or civilian personnel to a conflict zone to promote peace","Peace operations are composed of “military and/or civilian personnel deployed by one or more third-party states, frequently but not necessarily under the auspices of a global or regional organization” (Mullenbach 2005, p. 529). The mandates and composition of peace operations can vary widely, from civilian observer missions to missions authorized to use military force to enforce the peace. Common goals include mitigating hostilities, restoring state authority, preventing recurrence of civil war, and/or achieving humanitarian goals, including the protection of civilians.","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, and (2) protecting vulnerable civilian populations","If peace operations help prevent the outbreak or recurrence of armed conflict, they would reduce the likelihood of mass atrocities because armed conflict is the strongest risk factor for mass atrocities. In addition, if peace operations provide direct physical protection to civilian populations; defeat, detain, or degrade the capacity of atrocity perpetrators; and/or shift armed actors’ calculations of the costs and benefits of targeting civilians (e.g., by publicizing violations), they would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities.","Operational","Yes","Military",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"2",23,"Mediation","Tool","Mediation_tool","A non-legal conflict management process facilitated by an external actor","Mediation is “a process of conflict management where disputants seek the assistance of, or accept an offer of help from, an individual, group, state or organization to settle their conflict or resolve their differences without resorting to physical force or invoking the authority of law” (Bercovitch et al. 1991, p. 8).","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, and (2) facilitating a political transition.","If mediation helps prevent or end an armed conflict, it would reduce the likelihood of mass atrocities because armed conflict is the strongest risk factor for mass atrocities (Bellamy 2011; Straus 2016).","Operational","Yes","Diplomatic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"3",95,"Prosecutions","Tool","Prosecutions_tool","Legal proceedings against suspected perpetrators of mass atrocities","Prosecutions of atrocity crimes are attempts to hold individuals criminally accountable for mass atrocities through national courts, the International Criminal Court, international tribunals, hybrid courts, or universal jurisdiction. This review is limited to analyses of the effects of actions to advance cases through courts, such as the referral of a case to a court, the opening of an investigation, indictments, arrest warrants, trials, and sentencing.","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, and (2) facilitating a political transition.","If prosecutions increase the expected costs to individuals of committing atrocities, they would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities. In addition, if prosecutions satisfy the desire for justice for past atrocities, they would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities that might be committed to exact revenge on perpetrator groups. If prosecutions help remove individual perpetrators from positions of power or influence, they would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities by facilitating a transition to a less atrocity-prone political leadership.","Operational","Yes","Legal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This review does not include analyses of direct military intervention in support of a non-state armed group.","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, (2) degrading potential perpetrators’ capacity to commit atrocities, (3) protecting vulnerable civilian populations, and (4) facilitating a political transition.","If support to a non-state armed group enables the group to provide physical protection to civilian populations, to increase costs to other armed actors of committing atrocities (e.g., by attacking them in response to atrocities), or to destroy or degrade other groups’ capacities to commit atrocities, it would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities.

"5",10,"Targeted sanctions","Tool","Targeted sanctions_tool","Coercive measures that target the assets or activities of individuals or corporations","Targeted sanctions are “coercive economic measures taken against a target to bring about a change in behavior.” Targeted sanctions, which aim at specific individuals or entities, include “blocking of foreign assets under U.S. jurisdiction [and] prohibition on economic transactions [with sanctions targets] that involve U.S. citizens or businesses” (CRS 2021, p. 1). (Note that some studies reviewed consider arms embargoes as a type of targeted sanction. The Simon-Skjodt Center also reviewed evidence on arms embargoes separately due to the depth of research on the use and effects of this tool specifically.)","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, (2) degrading potential perpetrators’ capacity to commit atrocities, and (3) facilitating a leadership or political transition","If targeted sanctions raise the individual costs on the commission of atrocities, they will reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities. These costs can be material (e.g., by freezing or seizing assets), reputational, or political. In addition, if targeted sanctions degrade perpetrators’ capacity to commit atrocities by denying them or raising the costs of acquiring critical means, such as funds, arms, and other enabling technological goods, they will reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities (Krain 2017; Lopez 2015).","Operational","Yes","Economic, Diplomatic, Legal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Arms embargoes can target one or all sides of a conflict (“partial” and “impartial” arms embargoes, respectively) (SIPR 2007, pp. 2-3).","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, and (2) degrading potential perpetrators’ capacity to commit atrocities","If arms embargoes deny potential perpetrators access to arms or raise the costs of acquiring arms, they would reduce the likelihood or severity of mass atrocities by constraining their capacity for violence. If arms embargoes increase the expected cost of committing mass atrocities, potential perpetrators would be more likely to choose alternative options (Brubaker and Dorfler 2017, pp. 2, 8).","Operational","Yes","Military, Economic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These costs can be material (e.g., by increasing the relative economic strength of the opposition), reputational, or political (e.g., by contributing to social upheaval) (Wood 2008, p. 491).

Diplomatic sanctions may specifically entail not recognizing a regime in public statements, withdrawing staff from or closing an embassy, “restrictions on travel for specific leaders” (MacGregor and Bowles 2012, p. 445), and “suspension of membership or expulsion from international or regional bodies” (ICISS 2001, p. 31). Diplomatic sanctions are intended to “signal disapproval of the target regime's behaviour, and also to signal the possibility of subsequent punitive measures should that behaviour not change” (Krain 2014, p. 27).","(1) dissuading potential perpetrators from committing atrocities, and (4) facilitating a political transition.","If diplomatic sanctions impose reputational costs on potential perpetrators and/or increase their expectation that external actors will impose other costs in the future in response to atrocities, they would reduce the likelihood of mass atrocities.

Our research review includes studies of the linkage between development assistance of any or all sectors with mass atrocities or closely related outcomes. As such, it is not a detailed review of alternative program-level interventions.
