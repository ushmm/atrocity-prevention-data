Things need to have happened, like in the case of the Rohinga. Difficult part of prevention proving the negative. Would have it have been worse without targeted sanctions? Only honest answer is sometimes. You think about Crimia, where sanctions haven't worked, but were it not for sanctions, would they be in Kiev? Would the situation be worse? If we think about when people are preventing atrocities, people are committing atrocities not for venal reasons, but for what they view as just reasons. Not a situation in which they are as responsive to dollars and cents.

","Think about sanctions, usually financial, making a target a pariah of financial community.

It’s a very specific issue in the sanctions world, do they work, do they succeed. They only ever work when there is a clear policy objective and support for that objective by way of a diplomatic process. I believe they almost never directly change behavior or on their own they never succeed in stopping atrocities. They contribute to the policy framework to stop atrocities. Sanctions on their own, if mass killing is going on in Burma, South Sudan, wherever, sanctions alone will not work and can’t work. It's challenging to say, of course I think they fail if done poorly.   Kyra: what context/design allow them to work better (rephrased question), overall what would you say their success has been in lowering (preventing or mitigating) the risk of mass atrocities? I would say sometimes, the middle of the road answer. ",,Yes,There is an ongoing diplomatic process intended to resolve the conflict,More,Somewhat confident,"Diplomatic processes with whoever the actors are on the ground. Sanctions are better when they bring actors perpetrating atrocities to the table (perpetrators, their proxies, whatever it is) some framework when there is going to be negotiation. Without diplomatic process, sanctions simply by the force they bring are unlikely to change the situation. Have had conversations with diplomats who don't understand what sanctions are, or understand what they were in the context of 1990s Iraq but not now. ",Yes,Target has ties to the international financial system,More,Somewhat confident," Link factor between the United States and the context on the ground is some kind of economic activity, there is some kind of business activity. Perpetrators and their proxies are engaged in some kind of activity that is vulnerable to sanctions. That economic activity involves transactions in USD/euros or something in the international system so that if the sanctions are imposed they can actually be enforced. Somewhat confident, you can have an entity involved in the financial system-- if they are connected to the financial system, they probably understand how to hide themselves/start a new company. Sanctions have to stay on top of who is designated. Often they're good at initial targeting, but six months later those actors are back and have several new companies. That's a slightly different factor. This is an important piece of the puzzle.",Yes,Targets are key actors in systems that are perpetuating mass atrocities,More,Very confident,"If the targets are key actors in the system that are perpetrating mass atrocities, they don't have to be commanders/or people committing mass atrocities, they need to be pieces of the puzzle/key to the system even if they are not necessarily directly responsible for the atrocities. If we go after the right people and they feel pressure. Usually they are politically sensitive. ",Yes,Good intelligence about the targets,More,Somewhat confident,Clear targets and clear information about those targets that allows for the targeting of meaningful/relevant actors. Number of failed examples where people who were targeted were not particularly relevant to the atrocities themselves or had no financial standing that made an effect. Those always fail. Do you have a clear sense of who you want to target and do you have enough intelligence so that the banks will actually be able to enforce them? Good intelligence about the subjects. Do we have a full picture of their business network? Good intelligence and willingness to use it.,Yes,Commitment,More,Very confident,"Great deal of resources and commitment, that's a version of that. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,The sanctions serve a clear policy objective,More,Somewhat confident,"There has to be a set of policy objectives that the sanctions are working towards. Sanctions serve a clear policy objective, rather than “have” a clear policy objective. Policy comes first, sanctions are the tool.",Yes,Multilateral,More,Somewhat confident,"Either in USG or whatever broader coalition we’re working with-- I do believe sanctions are better when multilateral. The US is usually more aggressive with sanctions than anywhere else. I don't think sanctions have to be multilateral. There needs to be a policy framework. In the literature, you see sanctions as a tool. Can only be a tool if there is a policy framework in support of it. The context has to be a multifaceted policy framework in which sanctions are clearly designed to support an element of it. A lot of people put multilateralism as essential. At best, somewhat important.",Yes,Multiple types of sanctions are used,More,Somewhat confident,"Targeted sanctions tend to mean putting individuals and companies on the list administered by OFAC and maybe align with visa bans by State Department. Sanctions tend to be more useful when a sort of broader categories of sanctions is available, whether that is commerce-level restrictions, relates to USAID work, other kinds of business-related sanctions if we have something besides just putting people on list of freezing assets, that is an important contextual element that will determine whether sanctions work. ",Yes,Clear communication from OFAC to banks about what the sanctions are and how to implement the sanctions,More,Somewhat confident,"Clarity for implementation, related to intelligence point a little bit. Sanctions are mostly implemented by banks, they are the main enforcement driver. From time to time, sanctions are developed that aren't clear. There are other forms of targeted sanctions (stopping certain actions/relations), if they are not clear then banks won't know how to implement them. Policymakers in a complex environment may get detached from reality. Clarity for implementation/enforcement. Clarify: Clear instructions, sanctions are clear on their face. When the US imposed sanctions at the end of 2020 on China because of its activities in Hong Kong, it caused chaos in the banking sector, and the government issuing them wasn't implementable without much more guidance. OFAC had an FAQ page about the sanctions, issued a lot (the better the sanctions, the less FAQs). They only provide guidance through FAQs, they used to have a different range of options for issuing guidance. The more FAQs, the less likely banks know what they're supposed to do or stop. Important actor. A lot of banks would say there are times banks can’t be sure they are implementing sanctions because of lack of communication with OFAC. Situations more complicated tend to be Russia, China, where there's a lot of complicated business transactions going on. When talking about mass atrocities, probably less likely complicated business going on. Burma, one example, oil companies have been confused with what OFAC is doing. It can happen, probably worth flagging as a design factor. Both a complicated context and OFAC doing a bad job communicating-- OFAC often doesn’t want to be clear and wants to be vague in the interest of stopping more transactions, not always, but sometimes. Vagueness leaves everyone befuddled. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,The sanctions are aggressively enforced through penalties (on American companies) for violating the sanctions,More,Somewhat confident,"One that comes to mind, enforcement. What I’ve talked about mostly is about the implementation side (do we have enough intelligence about potential targets, etc). The flip side is the enforcement piece. Over time, especially in the case of mass atrocities, there is a much shorter time lens applied. Talking about Iran, Russia, Cuba-- you’re looking at decades. Idea of enforcement, are you issuing penalties against foreign/American actors/companies for violating the sanctions? If you don't have an enforcement approach, it can weaken effectiveness because people think they can violate without getting caught. OFAC has limited enforcement division; most information comes from people self-reporting violations rather than OFAC finding them. In the case of mass atrocities, impending or ongoing genocide, if you want to stop now, you are less worried about long term penalties, if still talking about mass atrocities multiple years later, we lost it, I’m sure. Does sanction come with aggressive enforcement? Foreign actors facing monetary penalties will deter banks/companies. Somewhat (between somewhat and very). In the Iran case, aggressive enforcement was part of what led to the Iran-Nuclear agreement.

"," I don't think you can think about a tool in isolation. Sanctions have to be part of a much broader strategy using different elements of government power to be effective in the long term. People make the mistakes of thinking we can issue sanctions and solve the problem. One of the biggest mistakes people make is that they think they can issue a sanction, issue a press release, and walk away to the next problem. Does not work that way. I ran all this when I was at the Treasury. Often people think there is a problem, can go to the sanctions tool, and then think we have done something to solve the problem. Not thinking creatively about all the other things that would have been done had sanctions not been available. The State Department would often come to do the sanctions for symbolic reasons. Can be lazy thinking, unlikely to have an impact. People may be suffering on the ground, it has no impact and we have wiped our hands. I think it's more dangerous than not effective. Sanctions used with other tools and the discipline not to resort to that tool when we know it's not going to be effective. If you sanction someone with no connection to the financial system, people might care less, could be seen as a badge of honor when they know they can't trust you. In some places in the world, it might not be effective, so let's think about other things we can do to hold people to account. The most effective use of sanctions in the human rights form. When it all started in the 1940s, and from Rebecca Erbelding’s book, the US government was able to freeze 8 billion in 1940s USD, able to freeze massive amounts of money and keep it out of Hitler’s hand.

If someone doesn't commit a mass atrocity, are we going to say it was because of sanctions, are we going to say it's sanctions or because they weren't as evil as we thought. I don't know. This is something we should do. For people who commit mass atrocity, whatever consequence we impose, we should do it, because it might deter something in the future. People who commit mass atrocities now, they know the US even with a powerful military is not likely to prevent it militarily. The level of our deterrence is not as great as we would like. We need to increase it. I would hate for the notion that some professor says it isn't effective so therefore we should not do it. This is worth doing, we're talking about saving lots of lives. I would do it even if we couldn’t prove it would be effective. That’s my view. Are we going to send our military into Myanmar, we’re not, so we should do whatever we can do to create whatever deterrence we can create.",,Yes,Target cares about its reputation and ability to operate in the international system,More,Very confident,"his Is the hardest question of all. Probably thousands of contextual factors. What makes targeted sanctions most useful: do you have a target (regime or set of individuals), the extent that target wants to be integrated into the outside world. If the target has a need or desire to be connected to the outside world. Experienced by the success of visa sanctions in the DOJ, leaders of the regime wanted to send their kids to the US. The extent that it's North Korea, it's harder, because there's no desire to be integrated.  	KF: if the target cares about reputation? 	SL: Reputation is part of it; their ability to operate, reputation, ability to travel, financial  connections. ",Yes,Target has the power and discretion to change the conduct/commission of mass atrocities,More,Somewhat confident,"You have to choose your target for that context. We see now, targeting individuals that have no discretion anyways, functionaries in a regime where they have no discretion, that limits the effectiveness. Does the target have the capability to change what you want changed? In the Uyghur situation, does the target have the discretion to make a change in the conduct. Going after the police chief, that person doesn't have the discretion. That would be a different outcome: condemnation rather than conduct. If targeting those that have the ability to change the conduct. Makes a difference, you’re talking about the worst people.",Yes,Clear communication about when the sanctions would be lifted or about red lines after which the sanctions will not be lifted,More,Very confident," In what circumstances are you willing to lift the sanctions? Suppose there’s an actual mass atrocity that you think is going to continue and you impose targeted sanctions and they stop, will you lift the targeted sanctions because they stopped killing people. Probably not. What is it you are trying to get at? There’s something to declare inappropriateness and condemning behavior, but what are you trying to achieve? Behavior change? A deterrent for someone else? That's a policy decision folks will make. 	More likely. Hard to point to historical examples of that working, but makes it more likely  to prevent. Argument can be made that it’s about preventing the next one: creating deterrence. Main policy recommendation: Create a framework; if you cross this line, there will be massive and consequential sanctions on those responsible. If you get people in advance to go along with that coalition. We don’t have the same agreement that we have around terrorism. That if you commit a mass atrocity, something really terrible is going to happen: Sanctions imposed and private sector on board .. to build up in advance the deterrence is important.  Once that happens, it’s hard to implement sanctions and then lift the sanctions once mass atrocities stopped.  When I was at Treasury, I worked with the Museum to create a framework for deterrence. Syria experience mattered to a lot of people. Good idea to create a system for deterrence in advance, or in a specific situation. Can be contextualized to one particular incidence.",Yes,Commitment - the US prioritizes these sanctions,More,Very confident,"I guess I do (agree with commitment as an important factor). May have thought about it differently. The United States as a sanctioning body can make any sanction stick if they decide they want it to stick. The question is where it falls on the list of priorities. If the United States sanctions 50 things and a lot of it doesn't get the same reinforcement or acceleration. The experience with Iran, they knew we cared and we had the backing all the way up to the President, that's what you need. You need to say that important enough, can make everything a high priority. How high it is as a priority. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Private sector participates in a multilateral coalition that implements the sanctions,More,Very confident,"Most important to build a coalition in advance, may not be the UN for obvious reasons. Could build a coalition anyways. You got this as something with which big corporations view as part of their due diligence on appropriate business partners. Not just banks, but corporations in general. Should be part of what they're all looking at. Part of looking at a supply chain. Making sure you're not associated with mass atrocities.  Multilateralism, but not just about the government, but about the private sector. We should not ignore the ability of international businesses to do these things. That is what made Iran sanctions work, we got them to do things they didn't have to do by law.  This is the one that for practitioners, commentators, researchers, it's harder to analyze and think about, it's undervalued. Undervalued as a factor. Get in the habit of talking to governments. Sanction officials fly around the world and talk to counterparts. Making a mistake, should be flying around the world and talking to CEOs. Multilateralize these things but go to the people who are making these decisions.",Yes,Sanctions target assets or other issues (e.g. travel) that the targets care about,More,Somewhat confident,"Aiming for the pain point of the particular target. The example I had wasn’t about mass atrocities. The real pressure point for this government was visas to the United States. Nothing to do with mass atrocities: when designing sanctions, what's likely to persuade them. For this country it was visa sanctions and they changed their policies. For small countries, OFAC at the Treasury isn’t always the right tool. Depends on what the target is. If the sanctions target the pain point of a particular target (not assets as implies money). We should not underestimate the power of targeting what the people in these countries want, e.g., to send their kids to America, if you can get people on the Interpol list, get Europe to get along with you. The elite want to get out, they want their kids and family to get out.

It’s great we have warning signs, but we should be trying to make this a part of the general conversation. We should be trying to get a framework in place so people realize this is something [referring to targeted sanctions] that happens when there is mass atrocity. Creating a general framework for businesses in the private sector in general and not just when there are warnings for specific cases.   I think it's very hard to reverse sanctions after the atrocities occur even if it stops, might make it more effective, but not really going to stop. I think that's fine. The hardest possible question: are you really going to give an incentive for someone to stop an atrocity? I haven't done a detailed analysis. What we have done with Sudan, did we reverse sanctions on people we felt had been complicit? I don't know the answer to that, but there are people who would, would  be worth analyzing.  Very hard to come up with a formula for what to do in advance. Thousands of contextual factors, trying to identify them is difficult. It is difficult, but coming up with a framework of what should happen in advance is valuable, have to adjust to the context whatever it is. It is impossible to predict.    Perpetrators of mass atrocities are pretty bad, hard targets. We should do these things alongside other things. How likely they are to work, going to be hard.

They can provide a signaling effect which can be useful. There are targets that resent/are upset by being added to a sanctions list. A government that has embarked on a program of mass atrocities typically has a high commitment to that policy, not done on a whim. The domestic and political forces to overcome are huge. A more policy relevant question is the use of broad sanctions to deter mass atrocities. The only time sanctions have changed a significant policy were broad sanctions (South Africa in response to apartheird / sanctions drove Iran to come to table for nuclear deal / in Sudan, change in policy for South Sudan and other key issues plaguing US-Sudan relations, not necessarily Darfur). Severe limits on what targeted sanctions can achieve if looking at major government policy you seek to change.   LW clarification: broader sanctions are effective because there is more of an impact on domestic/political context that is a stronger drive on the situation than targeted sanctions? AS: Yes, the government's I mentioned were afraid of running out of money. If they can’t provide  basic necessities and the risk of being pushed out of power. Interesting middle cases because it's a spectrum. If you sanction the largest oil entity in Iraq, responsible for 80% of revenue, considered broad sanction.  ",,Yes,Target is “plugged in”/has assets in the international system,More,Very confident,"Relations between sending and receiving country-- talking about atrocities going on in Turkey, has a rocky but historically close relationship with the United States. Government officials have assets in the US, greater potential for leverage than for somewhere like Libya or Sudan. Can situate countries on that spectrum, Myanmar would be somewhere in between. Somewhere like Belarus, there would likely be a greater impact for EU sanctions. How intertwined, first thing that comes to mind. KF: If the target has assets in the implementing country/desire to travel in the implementing country.? AS: The more plugged in the individual is in the international system, wealthy Chinese officials with no assets in the United States but businesses with Singapore and India, targeted sanctions will make a big difference because you have a lot to lose and need the USD. *Likely 3rd or 4th order effect it might have in preventing mass atrocities, way you phrased it seems oversimplified, claiming too much for any sanction. These factors are drivers in terms of the impact of the sanctions. Now you can then start to extrapolate for what impactful sanctions might mean for impacting the government. *to pull back, struggle to think of incidents where targeted  have impacted ongoing atrocities or prevented the outbreak. The whole discussion is against that backdrop, a very poor if 0 track record. If that's the case, why do it at all. I do think there's value. Can't think of a case where we targeted senior officials/elites/cronies. It makes it hard to say, doing smart designations against more vulnerable targets makes it more likely to, we are talking about the entire set is unlikely to impact the outcome.

Janjaweed in Darfur, no impact since they have no assets/plans to leave. More senior/wealthy elites, potentially see greater impact. KS: If sanctions target elite/high level targets?

Not an effectiveness question, not the right thing to do.

KF: Included in the commitment question? AS: I think most people outside of the world of sanctions might understand commitment to mean something emotional.
